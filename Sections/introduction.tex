\subsection{Problem Definition}

TA-58 produces a methane-rich associated gas stream containing \SI{1800}{ppmv} \ce{H2S}, exceeding the \SI{45}{ppmv} fuel specification for the installed Caterpillar G3408 (HPG) dual-gas engines \cite{TA58Dataset}. Under current practice, most associated gas is routed to flare while the pump station relies on diesel at an estimated \SI{500000}{\USD\per\yr}. Implementation of an \ce{H2S} removal system enables: (i) on-spec fuel gas for engine operation; (ii) reduced routine flaring and \ce{SO2} emissions; and (iii) diesel displacement with corresponding \ce{CO2} and cost reductions.

The gas stream also contains \SI{2.86}{\percent} \ce{CO2} (\SI{28550}{ppmv}), which creates a selectivity challenge: non-selective absorption would consume caustic at rates that render the project economically unviable. As Pudi et al.\ \cite{Pudi2022} note in their comprehensive review of \ce{H2S} capture technologies, the presence of \ce{CO2} fundamentally influences technology selection and operating strategy for sour gas treatment.

\subsection{Study Scope}

This study evaluates the technical and economic feasibility of treating the TA-58 sour associated gas to engine fuel-gas specification. The scope comprises:
\begin{romanlist}
  \item feed characterisation and design basis establishment;
  \item comparative evaluation of applicable \ce{H2S} removal technologies;
  \item conceptual equipment sizing with material balances;
  \item techno-economic assessment against the diesel displacement baseline;
  \item integration requirements with existing systems.
\end{romanlist}

Exclusions: detailed engineering, vendor guarantees, formal process safety studies (HAZID/HAZOP/LOPA), procurement, permitting, and commissioning support.

\subsection{Design Basis}

The key design inputs are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:design_basis_intro}, based on operational data from the TA-58 facility \cite{TA58Dataset}.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Design basis parameters}
\label{tab:design_basis_intro}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Value} & \textbf{Units} \\
\midrule
Gas source & VRU discharge & --- \\
Flow rate (standard) & 660,000 & SCFD \\
Flow rate (SI equivalent) & 779 & Nm$^3$/h \\
Total molar flow & 31.3 & kmol/h \\
Inlet \ce{H2S} & 1,800 & ppmv \\
Inlet \ce{CO2} & 28,550 & ppmv (2.86\%) \\
Required outlet \ce{H2S} & $<45$ & ppmv \\
Removal efficiency & $>97.5$ & \% \\
Operating temperature & 25--40 & \si{\celsius} \\
Operating pressure & Atmospheric & --- \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

At the design flow rate, the component molar flows are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\ce{H2S} load:} $31.3 \times 0.0018 = \SI{0.056}{kmol/h}$ (\SI{1.9}{kg/h} or \SI{46}{kg/day})
\item \textbf{\ce{CO2} load:} $31.3 \times 0.0286 = \SI{0.90}{kmol/h}$ (\SI{39}{kg/h})
\item \textbf{Molar ratio \ce{CO2}/\ce{H2S}:} $\approx 16:1$
\end{itemize}

The 16-fold excess of \ce{CO2} relative to \ce{H2S} creates the central design challenge: if \ce{CO2} is absorbed non-selectively alongside \ce{H2S}, caustic consumption becomes economically prohibitive (see Section~\ref{sec:technology_options}).

\subsection{Technology Screening Summary}

The screening evaluation considered technologies capable of reducing \ce{H2S} from \SI{1800}{ppmv} to $<\SI{45}{ppmv}$ (approximately 97.5\% removal). Caustic scrubbing was selected for detailed evaluation based on operability at low pressure, tolerance to liquid carryover, and potential for sulfide stabilisation via biological treatment \cite{Pudi2022}. Alternative technologies (membrane + ZnO, liquid redox, chemical scavengers) were not advanced due to technical or economic limitations at the site scale.

A key design consideration is the presence of \ce{CO2}: the rate constant for \ce{CO2} absorption in caustic is approximately $10^6$ times slower than for \ce{H2S}, which can be exploited through contactor design to achieve selective removal and limit caustic consumption \cite{AFPM2014,Danckwerts1965,astarita1983}.

Figure~\ref{fig:h2s-logic-clean} illustrates the design logic flow from feed characterisation through to operability limits, highlighting the critical linkages between feed conditions, solvent selection, and equipment sizing.

\subsection{Decision Criteria}

Project progression is recommended when:
\begin{romanlist}
  \item treated gas meets \SI{45}{ppmv} \ce{H2S} specification;
  \item a practical sulfur-handling route is defined;
  \item screening-level risk assessment indicates manageable hazards;
  \item positive economics relative to diesel displacement at AACE Class~3 maturity;
  \item tie-ins are feasible within site constraints.
\end{romanlist}
