\caption{Conversion versus contact time for \ce{H2S} and \ce{CO2} absorption in caustic. The shaded region indicates the SCT selectivity window (10--100~ms) where \ce{H2S} absorption is complete while \ce{CO2} absorption remains negligible. Packed columns operate at longer contact times (0.5--5~s), approaching equilibrium for both species.}
